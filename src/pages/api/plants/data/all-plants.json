Use an indoor container mix that is well-draining mixed with a third cactus mix for good drainage. Add soil to the bottom to elevate the root ball. Lift the plant and inspect the root ball. Notice if there are any dead or rotting roots and trim off with sterile pruners. If the plant is rootbound, untangle the roots to alleviate continued encircling. Trim up the side of the root ball so new roots will form. Ensure the plant is sitting about 1\" below the edge of the pot to avoid water spillage. Add more soil and backfill around the sides by tamping down. Do not cover the current level of soil on the plant but add soil up to this level. Water thoroughly, leaving the soil damp but not soggy. Add more soil after watering if the soil settles.",

Be generous by digging a hole twice the pot's width and 1 inch shorter than the grower pot to raise it above the soil level for good drainage. Use a pitchfork or a sharp object to stab the soil walls to make several indentions for the roots to take hold. Tickle the roots to loosen them if they wrap inside the container. Place the plant in the center of the hole. Fill the hole with water first, so the roots get another good drink. Next, backfill with native soil mixed with compost by one third to one half (if the native soil is clay). Add a rooting hormone fertilizer to this backfill mixture. Tamp the soil firmly down around the edges and mound up. Avoid covering the original soil level of the plant that was in the container. Add mulch as needed but not next to the stem or branches of the plant. Water lightly. Continue to observe the soil moisture each day, depending on the temperatures and soil drainage."

This end is the root end and goes downward in the soil. The opposite end of the bulb will be much smoother, with distinguished concentric rings around them. The sprout will emerge so that this end will be facing up. When you dig the hole, mix in some compost with the native soil and bulb fertilizer if the soil is compact. Mix it all well in a bucket together—Center the bulb in the middle of the hole and then water. Water before putting the soil back in. Plant the bulb in the ground with 50% showing above the soil surface. If growing in a planter container, use a well-draining potting soil with perlite to aerate the soil. Cut the leaves back and dig up in the fall before temperatures drop below 40°F. If you are in a cooler zone (3-8), remove the tubers from the soil with an inch of stem attached. Knock off all the soil and lay them on newspaper in a dry place for a week. Do not wet or wash the tubers. Sprinkle them with powdered sulfur to protect against fungi while they're in dormancy. Lay on a single layer screen or in a mesh bag so air can circulate around them. Store the tubers at 50°F-60°F."

        "The Aralia Fabian Stump is an extremely delightful indoor shrub. They have a thick woody stalk with small round leaves, which are green on the top and purple on the bottom. Their name comes from their height — in their natural habitat they only grow to a maximum height of four feet. The Aralia Fabian is a low-maintenance house plant, perfect for beginners, and makes a unique housewarming gift."

After several weeks, you'll notice roots bursting through nodules on the bottom of the stem and swelling offshoots emerging through the upper parts of the stem. Once there is a sufficient root system, dip the ends in root hormone (mixed in water at a paste consistency) and place in damp, well-draining, moist potting soil mix and tamp down around the stem to secure. Use a container that has drainage and is deep enough for the roots to grow. Place the stem at least 1-2 inches down into the soil. Set them in bright, indirect sunlight while they are rooting. Check the moisture and humidity each day and add misting to keep the soil moist while the roots establish. After 6-8 weeks, roots will begin to establish.

Water the soil and use a clear plastic bag, misting it with water, and place it over each leaf to create high humidity. Each week, check the soil moisture and water if needed. After 6-8 weeks, the roots should be firmly in place, and a new baby Croton will continue to grow fresh sprouts!"

Dip the ends in root hormone (mixed in water at a paste consistency) and place down to the first leaf intersection in the damp, well-draining, potting soil mix with perlite. Tamp down around the stem to secure them. Use a 2-3 inch container with a 5 inch deep base with deep drainage for the roots to grow. Mist inside a clear plastic bag to create moisture and humidity and place the bag over the top of the plantings loosely. There is no need to tie off the bag but allow a little airflow under and into the planting pot. Set it in bright, indirect sunlight while they are rooting. Check the moisture and humidity each day and add misting to the soil (not the leaves) while the roots establish. After 3-4 weeks, roots will begin to form. You can tug onto the stem to ensure the roots establish after new growth begins. Transplant to the garden after the roots are mature.",
            "Division: Wait to dig up your tubers three weeks after the last hard frost when all your annuals have died. Waiting this long will help toughen the skins and help protect them against shriveling and rot. Trim all the blackened stalks away and remove them. (If you live in a warmer climate, trim off the stems and foliage down to the ground to start the curing process two weeks before digging.) Use a pitchfork to dig up the tubers, place it about a foot away from the central stalk, and rock it back and forth to loosen the soil around the tubers. Go around the plant doing this, then gently lift the clump out of the ground. Hose off the tuber clump removing all the soil from the crevices. Lay them out to air dry in a well-ventilated area above 40°F. Within 24 hours, start splitting the clusters. Remove any broken or damaged tubers, including those with broken necks. Use sharp pruners and clip apart each tuber with a strong neck and visible eyes. Each eye is where a sprout will form. Prune any hairy roots or chunks around the neck. Each tuber should have a body, eye, and strong neck. Lay them all out and let them dry for a day before they start dehydrating and shriveling. If you have several varieties, label them with a permanent marker on the body of the tuber. Sprinkle the tubers with a powder fungicide such as sulfur dust to prevent disease and rot. To store, use a plastic bin, fill the bottom with vermiculite, and lay the tubers side by side but not touching. Then pour a layer of vermiculite over them so they're all covered, and repeat until the bin is full. Drill 2-3 holes in the plastic lid to help moisture expire. Store your container in an area between 40-50°F and 85 to 95% humidity. Check your tubers monthly for any rotting or mold and remove them.",
            "If you're in a hardy USDA growing zone of 9 or above, you can leave the tubers in the ground over the winter. Then, in the spring (May in most locations after the last frost), carefully dig them up, divide the tubers and replant them in several areas in the landscape or decorative patio containers."

Place the stem in a glass jar and fill with filtered water and watch the roots grow! Replace and freshen the water each week. After the roots are several months old, add to moistened potting soil, continue to water, and give them the bright, indirect lighting requirements. Soil propagation includes dipping the cutting in hormone stimulator and placing in prepared rich, well-draining, moist (but not soggy) soil with plenty of aeration. Keep the soil moist for approximately four weeks until roots begin to grow. You can tug slightly on the stalk to see if roots are grabbing and holding after this time. Provide them bright, indirect light to acquire the photosynthesis for growth to occur. Remove the plant from the pot. Hold the base and turn upside down with your palm securely holding the plant. Gingerly pull the pot off the root base. Remove the soil around the plant so the individual stalks can be separated. Use a chopstick to help wedge between the stalks and separate. Carefully separate all the roots to their individual stalks. Repot each in new well-draining aerated soil. Use a smaller pot for each stalk carefully not using a bigger pot may be harder to regulate their watering needs. Fill with soil, leaving an inch below the soil edge to eliminate water spillage.

        "The Golden Pothos is one of the worlds' best-selling plants, and for a good reason! They are basically impossible to kill and thrives in situations other plants can't handle. Golden pothos is so low-maintenance they have a reputation for being impossible to kill — hence their nickname, devil's ivy. They don't need much water, and they are quite happy in darker parts of your home. They can survive almost anything: from a few weeks without water to being placed in a room with low light. Not only are they easy to maintain, but the Golden Pothos is also extremely beautiful. A must for any Green Space!",
        "A natural air purifier, this golden pothos makes an ideal addition to your bedroom. Because of the attractive way their leaves drape, they are a popular option for hanging plants. Enjoy your plant hanging in the original grower pot or remove the hanger and admire them in the decorative pot of your choosing! Either one is a great display!"

Afterward, soak the seeds in warm water for 24 hours. Use a seed-starting mix and plant with a 1/4 inch layer of soil. Wet the surface with a spray bottle and cover the planter with a clear plastic bag to retain germination moisture. Keep at room temperature. Within three to four weeks, the seeds will germinate. Keep the soil medium consistently moist by spritzing with more water. Once seedlings emerge, remove the plastic wrap and place them in a bright, indirect lit window. After two leaves appear, it's time to separate them into individual containers to grow into mature ferns. Continue to nurture them by providing moisture and humidity. After two or three weeks from transplanting, fertilize monthly with a mixture of 1/2 strength during the growing season."

        "The Ionantha Fuego is a small air plant with fuzzy green leaves. When they bloom, they will transform into tones of red to contrast with their purple flowers. These plants are great for terrariums, crafts, and displays on shelves. After blooming, the plant will produce offsets to duplicate the parent plant as they slowly die. This process is a recycling process the air plant goes through to keep growing new plants! Add to a bright, indirect place, water regularly, and keep humidity high. Enjoy the ebb and flow of this plant for generations!"

Add mulch as needed but not next to the stem or branches of the plant. Water lightly. Continue to observe the soil moisture each day, depending on the temperatures and soil drainage. The soil needs to remain moist but not soggy during the growing season and until they get established. Let dry on the top few inches between waterings."

Use a knife or sharp pruners; cut below a node where there are at least two sets of leaves. Remove the bottom leaves to expose the last two nodes. Place the stems in rooting hormone and place the stem down into rooting medium. Tamp the soil around the stem gently and mist the soil. Place a clear plastic bag loosely over the 3-4 inch container to create humidity. Check the moisture of the soil and humidity each day. Place the cuttings in bright, indirect light. After the roots are six weeks old, they should be ready to transfer into the garden or container garden. Transition the cuttings a few hours per day to help them acclimate to the new environment."

Trim the Parsley with the seed heads and place into a bag to lightly remove the seeds. Dry the seeds in a warm place by turning them daily on a paper plate or towel for two weeks. Label and store in an envelope and place in an unused refrigerator for up to three years. To plant, use well-draining soil with rich nutrients and compost. The pH should be between 6-7. Use our 3 in 1 plant meter to test the pH. Soak the seeds in warm, soapy water for an hour. This procedure will break the outer layer of the seeds and help them germinate faster. Afterward, rinse the seeds in a colander with warm running water to remove the soap. Place the seeds in a warm bowl of water to soak overnight to help with germination. Then strain and place on wax paper to dry completely before planting. Prepare seed trays with well-draining moist soil for seedlings. Start this process 2-4 months before the last frost date in your area. Plant the seeds in 1/2 inch of soil and 12 inches apart if growing outside. Once the plant has germinated at around 70°F, let it grow to 3 inches before transplanting into the garden. Keep the seedlings in bright light or under grow lights to germinate."

Next, dig the hole twice as wide as the grower pot and the same depth as the grower pot (not deeper). Remove the plant and center in the spot. Add rooting hormone around the roots of the plant.

Place a piece of screening at the bottom of the container over the drainage hole to secure the soil and allow to drain. Use a well-draining indoor potting mix. A mix of 3 cups of potting soil, 2 cups of coconut coir, 4 cups of bark, 1 cup of perlite, and 1/4 cup of horticultural charcoal is perfect for this aroid. Water your plant in the old pot before transferring over and let sit for an hour. Add soil to the bottom to elevate the root ball. Lift the plant and release the roots against the existing planter. Use a clean knife or garden trowel to wedge between the pot and the soil to loosen. Inspect the root ball. Notice if there are any dead or rotting roots and trim them off with sterile pruners. Ensure the plant is sitting about 1 inch below the edge of the pot to avoid water spillage. Add more soil and backfill around the sides by tamping down. Fill up to the soil line but not over.

Water in the hole and let drain. Lavender will not survive in acidic or compact soils like clay. Keep the pH to 7.0, or add lime if the soil is too acidic. Mix sand or gravel into the native soil and plant in mounds or raised beds for good drainage. If you have clay soils, add composted leaves, mushroom compost, and perlite to enhance the soil consistency. Slopes work well too. Fill around the plant and up to the top of its soil line.

Next, take the cutting and dip them in rooting hormone. Use a succulent and cacti mix, and fill the container you're using. Poke the cuttings in the soil and water. Now, create a humidity chamber by spritzing a clear plastic bag and dropping it over the new plant and container. Place the cuttings in bright, indirect light. Keep the soil moist while the cuttings establish roots and leaf growth occurs."

        "Staghorn fern (Platycerium Bifurcatum) makes an attractive ornamental sculpture for a wall indoors or seasonally outdoors in warmer climates. The Royal Horticulture Society Award of Garden Merit gave the nod to this plant in 1993. Their sterile heart-shaped basal fronds overlap and shield the base of the fern's roots. Initially dull green and succulent, they turn papery tan to cinnamon-brown with age. The fertile or foliar fronds are brighter green, branched, and shaped like antlers grow from the base. Each frond forks into two or three portions several times along their length. Dark brownish masses on the underside of these fertile fronds' tips are spores. Many pups grow to comprise the entire plant but can be removed. This plant is an excellent living wall sculpture to any back porch or brightly lit interior space."

Use as an ornamental in the garden or a garden pot. Add it to your culinary dishes with meats and veggies, or make scented sachets.",

Use a wooden dowel to train them to stand upright until the roots are more anchored and secure."

        "We know there are different types of Snake Plants, and it can be tough to know which one to pick. Variegated, or Laurentii, is the most common one you're going to find and is really, really durable when it comes to growing conditions. We're talking extra tough, leave them and forget them (then remember them) tough. They are an interesting and attractive plant that is also durable for a wide range of conditions. They are an easy plant to care for and make for a great addition to your personal green space. They are also known as a great air purifier. They're native to West Africa and often used in Feng Shui."

        "The leading commercial variety of Sansevieria, known and grown for the hemp-like fiber in the leaves. They are an interesting and attractive plant that is also durable for a wide range of conditions. They are an easy plant to care for and make for a great addition to your personal green space. Species of the Sansevieria genus are recommended for air purification – particularly within the home and office.",
        "Fun fact: Under perfect conditions, a snake plant may produce a bloom. Flowers are born in large clusters and are generally white with a greenish tinge. They emit a sweet floral fragrance that can fill a room. They won't bloom with any regularity, as most bud just once every several years."
