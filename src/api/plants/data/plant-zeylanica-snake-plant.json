    "The leading commercial variety of Sansevieria, known and grown for the hemp-like fiber in the leaves. They are an interesting and attractive plant that is also durable for a wide range of conditions. They are an easy plant to care for and make for a great addition to your personal green space. Species of the Sansevieria genus are recommended for air purification – particularly within the home and office.",
    "Fun fact: Under perfect conditions, a snake plant may produce a bloom. Flowers are born in large clusters and are generally white with a greenish tinge. They emit a sweet floral fragrance that can fill a room. They won't bloom with any regularity, as most bud just once every several years."
