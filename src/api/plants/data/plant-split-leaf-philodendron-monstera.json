    "It doesn't get more iconic than the swiss cheese plant. Also known as Monstera Deliciosa, they are famous in interior design circles for their notched leaves. This large one will instantly bring on-trend jungle vibes to your home. They love to spread out, so give them plenty of space and use a coir pole to keep them upright. They are easy to care for and make an ideal first houseplant."
