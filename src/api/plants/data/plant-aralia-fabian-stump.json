    "The Aralia Fabian Stump is an extremely delightful indoor shrub. They have a thick woody stalk with small round leaves, which are green on the top and purple on the bottom. Their name comes from their height — in their natural habitat they only grow to a maximum height of four feet. The Aralia Fabian is a low-maintenance house plant, perfect for beginners, and makes a unique housewarming gift."
