Use a knife or sharp pruners; cut below a node where there are at least two sets of leaves. Remove the bottom leaves to expose the last two nodes. Place the stems in rooting hormone and place the stem down into rooting medium. Tamp the soil around the stem gently and mist the soil. Place a clear plastic bag loosely over the 3-4 inch container to create humidity. Check the moisture of the soil and humidity each day. Place the cuttings in bright, indirect light. After the roots are six weeks old, they should be ready to transfer into the garden or container garden. Transition the cuttings a few hours per day to help them acclimate to the new environment."
