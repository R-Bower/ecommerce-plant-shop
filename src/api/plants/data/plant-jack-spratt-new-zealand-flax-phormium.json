Cultivate the native soil for good drainage with organic matter like compost and sand with slightly acidic soil pH. Be generous by digging a hole twice the pot's width and 1 inch shorter than the grower pot to raise it above the soil level for good drainage. Use a pitchfork or a sharp object to stab the soil walls to make several indentions for the roots to take hold. Tickle the roots to loosen them if they wrap inside the container. Place the plant in the center of the hole. Fill the hole with water first, so the roots get another good drink. Next, backfill with native soil mixed with compost by one third to one half (if the native soil is clay). Add a rooting hormone fertilizer to this backfill mixture. Tamp the soil firmly down around the edges and mound up. Avoid covering the original soil level of the plant that was in the container. Add organic mulch as needed but not next to the leaves of the plant. Water lightly. Continue to observe the soil moisture each day, depending on the temperatures and soil drainage. The soil needs to remain moist but not soggy during the growing season and until they get established. Let them dry on the top a few inches between waterings."

    "The New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) tropical-looking, easy-care plant features long colorful sword-like leaves to emerge from a clump. Multicolored foliage of dark red, green, golden, purple, and burgundy make this an eye-catching display. Their grass-like texture makes them a perfect plant for planting in a mass on a bank or as a filler in a contemporary setting."
