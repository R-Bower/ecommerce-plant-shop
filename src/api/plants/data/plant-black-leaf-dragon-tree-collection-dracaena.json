Use a well-draining indoor potting mix with perlite to help with drainage.",

Place a piece of screening at the bottom of the container over the drainage hole to secure the soil and allow them to drain. Add soil to the bottom to elevate the root ball. Lift the plant and release the roots against the existing planter. Use a clean knife or garden trowel to wedge between the pot and the soil to loosen. Inspect the root ball.",

Set the stems in a jar filled with filtered, tap, or rainwater and replace the water twice a week. After several weeks, you'll notice roots bursting through nodules on the bottom of the stem and swelling offshoots emerging through the upper parts of the stem. Once there is a sufficient root system, dip the ends in root hormone (mixed in water at a paste consistency) and place in damp, well-draining, moist potting soil mix and tamp down around the stem to secure. Use a container that has drainage and is deep enough for the roots to grow. Place the stem at least 1-2 inches down into the soil. Set them in bright, indirect sunlight while they are rooting. Check the moisture and humidity each day and add misting to keep the soil moist while the roots establish. After 6-8 weeks, roots will begin to establish. You can tug onto the stem to ensure the roots are secure."
