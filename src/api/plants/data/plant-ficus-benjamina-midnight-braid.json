    "The Weeping fig (Ficus Benjamina) show off their slender trunks and lush green leaves in a weeping downward fashion. This Moraceae genus has an abundance of glossy leaves that cascade down, making them a statement piece. Set them in any bright, indirect lit room, and they will reach upwards of 10' tall in height over a long period. Add humidity around them to thrive."
