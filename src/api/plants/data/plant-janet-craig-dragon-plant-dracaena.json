Use an indoor container mix that is well-draining. Add soil to the bottom to elevate the root ball. Tenderly lift the plant and release the roots against the existing planter. Use a clean knife or garden trowel to wedge between the pot and the soil to loosen. Inspect the root ball. Notice if there are any dead or rotting roots and trim off with sterile pruners. If the plant was rootbound, cut through the roots to alleviate continued encircling. Ensure the plant is sitting about 1\" below the edge of the pot to avoid water spillage. Add more soil and backfill around the sides by tamping down. Do not cover the current level of soil on the plant but add soil up to this level. Replant and water thoroughly, leaving the soil damp but not soggy. Add more soil after watering if the soil settles. Hydrate the leaves with filtered water by spritzing. Your plant may wilt at first from transplanting but will recover shortly."

Place the stalk in a glass jar and fill with filtered water and watch the roots grow! Replace and freshen the water each week. After the roots are several months old, add to moistened potting soil and continue to water and give them the lighting requirements."
