Use a succulent and cacti mix, and fill the container you're using. Poke the cuttings in the soil and water. Now, create a humidity chamber by spritzing a clear plastic bag and dropping it over the new plant and container. Place the cuttings in bright, indirect light.

    "Your new favorite colorful succulent!",
    "An easy-to-grow, long-blooming succulent, Kalanchoes are a mainstay of just about any low-care space that wants a splash of color! They love bright, natural light without much direct sun. Since it's actually a succulent, their fat, fleshy leaves don't want to be watered all the time. Instead, they prefer less frequent waterings (and a little more when they're flowering).",
    "You will receive a surprise beautiful color from our collection!",
    "*Our blooms vary and may not arrive as they are pictured. We ship our plants still in buds, so you can enjoy a fresh bloom in your home.*"
