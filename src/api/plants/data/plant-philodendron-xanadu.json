Keep them consistently moist during the growing season (but not soggy) and let dry out to a 3 on the moisture meter in winter months when they are dormant. If yellowing leaves occur, back off on the watering and let the soil dry out a bit more between waterings."

Repot in the spring, using a 2\" bigger pot. (Too big of a pot could cause the soil to dry slower, which is not helpful.) Use a rich potting mix indoor potting soil mixed with coconut coir and perlite to help with drainage. Water your plant in the old pot before transferring over and let sit overnight. Place a piece of screening at the bottom of the container over the drainage hole to secure the soil and allow to drain. Add soil to the bottom to elevate the roots. Lift the plant and release the roots against the existing planter. Use a clean knife or garden trowel to wedge between the pot and the soil to loosen. Inspect the roots. Notice if there are any dead or rot and trim off with sterile pruners. If the plant is rootbound, separate the roots and divide if you wish to make more plants. If not, remove any weak leaves off the plant to help revitalize their energy. Ensure the plant is sitting about 1\" below the edge of the pot to avoid water spillage. Add more soil and backfill around the sides by tamping down. Fill up to the soil line but not over. Water thoroughly, leaving the soil damp but not soggy. If settling occurs, add more soil."

Carefully divide and repot in rich, indoor potting soil mixed with coconut coir and perlite, aware that each new plant needs at least two or more leaves with sufficient roots attached. Use a container 2 inches bigger than the root ball with drainage and deep enough for their roots to grow. Place the plant at the same level as the previous pot adding soil at the bottom. Water the soil and add more soil if settling occurs. Set them in medium to low, indirect sunlight while they are rooting. Check the moisture and humidity each day and add misting to keep the soil moist while the roots establish. After 6-8 weeks, roots will begin to establish. You can tug onto the stem to ensure the roots are anchoring well."
