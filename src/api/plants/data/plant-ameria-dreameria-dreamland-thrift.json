Fill around the plant and up to the top of its soil line. Tamp down with your hands to remove any air pockets. Water again around the drip line, being careful not to soak the leaves to help prevent fungus. Give this plant consistent waterings to allow the roots to establish but not remaining soggy. Mulch around the roots throughout the season."
