        "When receiving the Variegated Rubber Tree plant, do not repot immediately but wait at least 6-12 months. Repot in the spring, using a 2 inches bigger pot. Place a piece of screening at the bottom of the container over the drainage hole to secure the soil and allow it to drain. Use a well-draining potting mix half and half with a cacti and succulent potting mix to help with drainage. Water your plant in the old pot before transferring over and let it sit an hour. Add the soil mix to the bottom to elevate the root ball. Lift the plant and release the roots against the existing planter. Use a clean knife or garden trowel to wedge between the pot and the soil to loosen. Inspect the root ball. Notice if there are any dead or rotting roots and trim off with sterile pruners. If the plant is rootbound, loosen the roots to alleviate continued encircling. Ensure the plant is sitting about 1 inch below the edge of the pot to avoid water spillage. Add more soil and backfill around the sides by tamping down. Fill up to the soil line but not over. Water thoroughly, leaving the soil damp but not soggy. If settling occurs, add more soil. Water well to dampen the soil and let it drain."

Stick the stem into the soil mix. Use a pot with drainage and place the stem 1-2 inches down into the damp, well-draining, moist mixture of cacti and succulent soil and regular potting mix with perlite in equal parts. Tamp down around the stem securing it. Place a clear plastic bag over the cutting to mimic a greenhouse and mist the bag. Set it in bright, indirect sunlight while they are rooting. Check the moisture and humidity each day and add misting to keep the soil moist while the roots establish. After 6-8 weeks, roots will begin to establish. You can tug onto the stem to ensure the roots are secure. Remove the plastic bag but maintain adequate humidity around the new plant."
