If the plant is rootbound, cut through the roots to alleviate continued encircling. Ensure the plant is sitting about 1\" below the edge of the pot to avoid water spillage.

After 3-4 weeks, check to make sure the stem has 1-2 inch, well-formed roots. If so, it is time to plant. *Fill a small container with drainage holes (too large of a container for the cutting will make it challenging to regulate watering needs) using an indoor well-draining potting mix. Mix a little rooting hormone into the soil. Poke a hole in the soil with a pencil. Then, place the cutting in the hole and tamp the soil down around them. Water the plant and keep them in medium to bright indirect sunlight. After 4-6 weeks, the roots should establish."

    "Probably the most popular Feng Shui plant, the money tree is said to bring good luck and fortune wherever they go. They are also super easy to care for and can bounce back if you neglect them a little. This tropical indoor plant helps to purify the air and will thrive best in sunny spaces. This bonsai version makes a great starter plant and is a fantastic housewarming gift."
